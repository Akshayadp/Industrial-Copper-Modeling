# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

The Industrial Copper Modeling project addresses challenges in the copper industry related to sales pricing and lead classification. The project leverages machine learning techniques to predict selling prices of copper products and classify leads into 'Won' or 'Lost' categories. This project details the steps taken to preprocess data, build models, and create a Streamlit application for interactive predictions.

**Key Components**
* Data Preprocessing -Handling Missing Values, Treating Outliers, Skewness and Data Transformation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Visualizing Outliers and Skewness, Correlation Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Model Building and Evaluation - Regression Model (to predicts ‘Selling_Price’), Classification Model
